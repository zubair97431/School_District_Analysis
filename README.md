# School_District_Analysis
✓ How is the district summary affected?

-	The district summary in PyCitySchools_Challenge has been affected in the sense that all the averages scores and percentages went down compared to the original module work data. However, there was not a drastic variation.        

✓ How is the school summary affected?

-	In PyCitySchools_Challenge, the school summary shows for Thomas High school that the % Passing Math and % Passing Reading fell down drastically to the mid-60 percentage range compared to the original module work data. The % Overall Passing score fell down heavily too. However, the Average Math and Average reading scores went slightly up within the challenge data.    

✓ How does removing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance, relative to the other schools?

-	When we remove the ninth graders’ math and reading scores, Thomas High school overall seems to be in the underperforming range compared to its top range performance that previously showed in the original module work data. Therefore, relative to other high schools, Thomas High School is underperforming now.

✓ How does removing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

- Math and Reading Scores by Grade
-	By looking at “math scores per grade” and “reading scores per grade” it seems that only the ninth-grade category is affected. The math score average for the 9th grade went down barely in the challenge data vs the original module data. On the other hand, for reading score averages, it was the same situation: the average barely went down.     

- Scores by School Spending
-	For the challenge data and the original module data, they are both within the same spending ranges of $630-644 however the scores went down drastically in the challenge data. The % overall passing rate seems to be higher in the medium range.

- Scores by School Size
-	By school size, it appears that the small school size category is doing the best with their % overall passing rate.

- Scores by School Type
-	It appears Charter schools are doing better overall than District.
